\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This thesis presents an execution stack for neural networks using the
\emph{Kubernetes}\footnote{https://kubernetes.io} container
orchestration and a Java based microservice architecture, which is
exposed to users and other systems via RESTful web services and a web
frontend. The whole workflow including importing, training and
evaluating a neural network model, becomes possible by using this
service oriented approach (SOA). The presented stack runs on popular
cloud platforms, like \emph{Google Cloud Platform}\footnote{https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine},
\emph{Amazon AWS}\footnote{https://aws.amazon.com/eks} and
\emph{Microsoft Azure}\footnote{https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-service}.
Furthermore it is scalable and each component is extensible and
interchangeable. This work is influenced by N2Sky \cite{schikuta_2013},
a framework to exchange neural network specific knowledge and aims to
support \emph{ViNNSL}, the Vienna Neural Network Specification Language
\cite{kopica_2015} \cite{beran_2008}.

\paragraph{Objectives:}\label{objectives}

The first objective is to specify functional and non-functional
requirements for the neural network system. This is followed by the
characterisation of the API and the implemention of microservices that
later define the neural network composition as a collection of loosly
coupled services.

The next step is to setup a \emph{Kubernetes} cluster to create the
foundation of container orchestration.

Finally the microservices are deployed to containers and combined in a
cluster.

\paragraph{Non-Objectives:}\label{non-objectives}

The prototype does not fully implement the \emph{ViNNSL 2.0}, as
described in \cite{kopica_2015} and provides limited data in-/output.
This is described in section TODO.

\section{Motivation}\label{motivation}

Machine learning has become a highly discussed topic in information
technology in the past years and the trend is further increasing. It has
become an essential part of everyday life when using search engines or
speech recognition systems, like personal assistants. Self-learning
algorithms in applications learn from the input of their users and
decide which news an individual should read next, which song to listen
to or which social media post should appear first. Messages are being
analyzed and possible answers automatically predicted.

A recent Californian study shows that 6.5 million developers worldwide
are currently involved in projects that use artificial intelligence
techniques and another 5.8 million developers expect to implement these
in near future \cite{evans}.

Machine learning is not just a business area in the United States,
survey results of 264 companies in the DACH region show, that 56 of them
already use that kind of technology in production. In the near future
112 companies plan to do so or already have initial experiences (see
figure \ref{img.crisp_ml_verbreitung}). It is seen by a fifth of the
decision-makers as a core area to improve the competitiveness and
profitability of companies in future. \cite{crisp}

\caption{Distribution of machine learning of 264 companies in the DACH
region \cite{crisp}\label{img.crisp_ml_verbreitung}}
\end{figure}

At the same time more and more companies shift their business logic from
a monolithic design to microservices. Each service is dedicated to a
single task that can be developed, deployed, replaced and scaled
independently. Test results have shown that not only this architecture
can help reduce infrastructure costs
\cite{villamizar2}\cite{villamizar}, but also reduces complexity of the
code base and enables applications to dynamically adjust computing
resources on demand \cite{villamizar}.

The presented project combines these techniques and demonstrates a
prototype that is open-source and is supported by common cloud
providers. Developers can integrate their own solutions into the
platform or exchange components ad libitum.

\section{Container Orchestration}\label{container-orchestration}

\subsection{Docker Containers}\label{docker-containers}

Containers enable software developers to deploy applications that are
portable and consistent across different environments and providers
\cite{baier-kub} by running isolated on top of the operating system's
kernel \cite{bashari}. As an organisation, Docker\footnote{https://docker.com}
has seen an increase of popularity very quickly, mainly because of its
advantages, which are speed, portability, scalability, rapid delivery,
and density \cite{bashari}.

Building a Docker container is fast, because images do not include a
guest operating system. The container format itself is standardized,
which means that developers only have to ensure that their application
runs inside the container, which is then bundled into a single unit. The
unit can be deployed on any Linux system as well as on various cloud
environments and therefore easily be scaled. Not using a full operating
system makes containers use less resources than virtual machines, which
ensures higher workloads with greater density. \cite{joy2015}

\subsection{Microservices}\label{microservices}

The micoservice architecture pattern is a variant of a service-oriented
architecture (SOA). An often cited definition originates from Martin
Fowler and James Lewis:

\begin{quote}
In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to
developing a single application as a suite of small services, each
running in its own process and communicating with lightweight
mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around
business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated
deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management
of these services, which may be written in different programming
languages and use different data storage technologies.
\cite{lewis2014microservices}

\section{Machine Learning}\label{machine-learning}

\emph{Machine learning---the process by which computers can get better
at performing tasks through exposure to data, rather than through
explicit programming---requires massive computational power, the kind
usually found in clusters of energy-guzzling, cloud-based computer
servers outfitted with specialized processors. But an emerging trend
promises to bring the power of machine learning to mobile devices that
may lack or have only intermittent online connectivity. This will give
rise to machines that sense, perceive, learn from, and respond to their
environment and their users, enabling the emergence of new product
categories, reshaping how businesses engage with customers, and
transforming how work gets done across
industries.(https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/signals-for-strategists/machine-learning-mobile-applications.html)}

Technologies}\label{comparison-of-container-orchestration-technologies}

\subsection{Kubernetes}\label{kubernetes}

Kubernetes was developed by Google for administering applications, that
are provided in containers, in a cluster of nodes. The services that are
responsible for controlling the cluster are called master components
\cite{kub_intro}.

TODO Kubernetes is a system, developed by Google, for managing
containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. The controlling
services in a Kubernetes cluster are called the master components and
have a number of unique services which are used to manage a cluster's
workload and communications across the system \cite{kub_intro}.

\subsubsection{Master Components}\label{master-components}

\paragraph{etcd}\label{etcd}

etcd is a key-value store, accessible by a HTTP/JSON API, which can be
distributed across multiple nodes and is used by Kubernetes to store
configuration data, which needs to be accessible across nodes deployed
in the cluster. Is is essential for service discovery and to describe
the state of the cluster, among other things. \cite{kub_intro}

\section{Overview Microservices}\label{overview-microservices}

The neural network cloud execution stack consists of four main services
that expose a RESTful API to users and two supporting services in charge
of persisting data. Figure \ref{img.overview_main_services} shows an
overview of these services.

\subsection{Vinnsl Service
(vinnsl-service)}\label{vinnsl-service-vinnsl-service}

The \texttt{vinnsl-service} is responsible for handling the import,
management and manipulation of neural network objects and it's status.
It maps the CRUD\footnote{Create, Read, Update, Delete} operations to
HTTP methods. A new neural network is created by sending a \texttt{POST}
request to the \texttt{/vinnsl} endpoint containing a ViNNSL Definition
XML as body. Sending a \texttt{GET} request to the \texttt{/vinnsl}
route returns a JSON containing all ViNNSL neural network objects.

The \texttt{vinnsl-service} depends on the \texttt{vinnsl-db} service,
which runs a MongoDB database to store the objects.

\subsection{Worker Service
(vinnsl-nn-worker)}\label{worker-service-vinnsl-nn-worker}

The \texttt{vinnsl-nn-worker} implements a queue management for neural
network training and transforms ViNNSL neural network models into DL4J
models. It provides a wrapper of the DL4J platform, that handles the
training or evaluation of the network.

\subsection{Storage Service
(vinnsl-storage-service)}\label{storage-service-vinnsl-storage-service}

Binary files, like trained network models, images or csv files are
essential in the pocess of creating and training neural networks. File
management is handled by the \texttt{vinnsl-storage-service}.

\subsection{Frontend UI (vinnsl-nn-ui)}\label{frontend-ui-vinnsl-nn-ui}

The Frontend UI is a web application that gives a brief overview of all
neural network models, their training status and linked files.
